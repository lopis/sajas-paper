\begin{abstract}

Agent-based applications and simulations are in widespread use today both in research and industry.
Multi-Agent-Systems (MAS) and Multi-Agent-Based-Simulations (MABS) are two approaches to make use of multi-agent systems technology, each with distinct characteristics and goals.
While open agent-based applications benefit from adopting interaction standards, most MABS frameworks do not support them.
In this paper we propose an architecture, based on FIPA and Jade, for agent-based simulations, focusing on supporting agent communication using FIPA interaction protocols.
Based on this architecture, we present the \apiname{} API, whose goal is to bring JADE and
Repast, two popular MAS and MABS development frameworks,
closer together, facilitating the creation of simulations by JADE programmers and enabling an automatic portability between both tools.
For illustration, we show the creation of a simulation where agents interact in a contract net.
Finally, we present an early overview of a code conversion tool under development, whose aim is to automatically generate a Jade MAS from a Repast simulation that makes use of \apiname{}.
