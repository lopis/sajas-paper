\begin{abstract}

Agent-based applications and simulations are in widespread use today in many different subjects such as research, logistic and others. Multi-Agent-Systems (MAS) and Multi-Agent-Based-Simulations (MABS) are two similar concepts with distinct characteristics and goals. While open agent-based applications benefit from adopting interaction standards, many MAS/MABS development frameworks don't support them. In this paper we propose \apiname{} (standing for \emph{JADE-FIPA Flavored Protocols in Repast})(TODO: name is work in progress) which defines an architecture for agent-based simulations and includes a set of guidelines for the implementation of agent communication using FIPA interaction protocols. \apiname{}'s goal is to bring JADE and Repast, two popular MAS and MABS development frameworks, closer together, promoting the interoperability between them. For validation purposes, we tested the creation of a simulation where agents interact in a contract net. Finally, we present an early overview as future work the creation of a code conversion tool between the two frameworks, already under development.
