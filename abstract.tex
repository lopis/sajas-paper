\begin{abstract}
Multi-agent systems (MAS) present an interesting approach to the efficient development of modular systems. MAS are composed by autonomous computational units called agents that are programmed to compete or work together, for instance in order to solve computational problems, engage in automatic negotiation or play computer games. Frameworks exist that aid the development of this class of systems and they range from mostly general-purpose frameworks to domain-specific in an array of different domains.

Multi-agent-based simulations (MABS) are sometimes used on the course of development of a full-featured MAS - for instance, for testing purposes. However, most platforms for MAS development are not well suited for MABS development. 

TODO: JADE and Repast intro

In this paper, we propose the use of an API that complements Repast with the necessary FIPA protocols, present in JADE, that allow for standardized agent communication. By closing the gap between these two frameworks, we open the possibility for a more straightforward conversion of JADE applications to Repast simulations, and vice-versa. Thus, we also present in this paper the current prototype of a code conversion tool that makes this conversion possible.
