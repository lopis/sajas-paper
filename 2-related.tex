%% Intro to the related work
Some works have approached the problem of complementing Repast and JADE's features by bringing them together in a single framework by means of a middleware.
Following are two relevant examples we selected, MISIA \cite{garcia2011misia} and JRep \cite{gormer2011jrep}. They propose combining Repast and \gls{JADE}, allowing the creation of Repast simulations that also take advantage of JADE's networking capabilities and use of \gls{FIPA} standards.

%% MISIA
\subsection{MISIA}
MISIA's approach, as suggested by Figure \ref{fig:misia}, is to use a middle layer that acts as the bridge between the two other layers that interact with JADE and Repast Simphony.
By extending the agents in Repast and JADE, allowing them to communicate internally and synchronizing their state, these agents work as a single one.

\end{figure}

One of the challenges identified by the authors when re-implementing the FIPA interaction protocols was synchronizing them with the Repast tick-based simulation model.
Given JADE's event-driven architecture, MISIA proposes the use of a coordinator agent that informs the JADE-Agent when a tick has passed.
It also proposes its own implementation of the interaction protocols supported by JADE, making them tick-friendly.

%% JREP
\subsection{JRep}
JReps's approach is not as complex as MISIA's.
By having the Repast Simphony agent encapsulate the JADE agent representation, the synchronization is immediate and does not require an external coordinator.
The two agent representations take care of synchronizing any state changes.
Figure \ref{fig:jrep} represents the basic structure of this platform.

Each agent takes care of interfacing their respective frameworks. The interaction between agents in JRep is performed using FIPA ACL and the protocol implementations are provided by the JADE platform.


%% COMPARISON
\subsection{Comparison with \apiname{}}

JADE is a very rich platform but, for many simulation scenarios, the overhead introduced by it has a significant impact on simulation performance \cite{mengistu2008scalability}. \apiname{}, as we describe with more detail in the section \ref{sec:proposal}, uses an architecture that is conceptually very close to JADE's but tailored for Repast with no extra dependencies. In fact, the API could be used with other simulation frameworks with little adaptation.

As suggested by Figure \ref{fig:related-repacl}, \apiname{}'s general structure is simpler than that of JRep and MISIA. Our API does not intend to maintain an active connection to a JADE platform, eliminating the need for synchronization. Instead, our goal is to replicate in our API the main features of JADE, allowing for a straightforward and dependency free feature mapping between our API and JADE.

\end{figure}

One problem that is evident in both these frameworks is the fact that they are never truly free from JADE. Even though they attempt to integrate the features from both JADE and Repast, as far as Repast simulations are concerned, JADE's multi-threaded infrastructure affect their performance very significantly. The main advantage of our approach is, therefore, the possibility of using Repast with JADE features, namely interaction protocols, without the need to interface with JADE.
